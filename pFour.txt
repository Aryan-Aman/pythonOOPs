Inheritance /creating subclasses :
-inherit attr and methods from parent class
-can overrite or add new functionality without effecting parent class

** Method resolution order :
when a subclass inherits from multiple parent classes, the method resolution order (MRO) determines which class's method is called when a method is invoked on an instance of the subclass
order in which Python searches for a method in the inheritance graph. It's a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the inheritance graph.
print(help(Class_name)) - for MRO

-let add a progm lang to dev class :> use super or Employee.(args)

**never pass data types like list,dict as default args


**built-in class :
isinstance : if an obj is an instance of a class ?
issubclass : class is subclass of another ?
