Instance variables vs Class variables:(here only Instance)
    -contains data which is unique to each instance

init method/>initialize/>constructor
    -when we create method/methods within a class they receive instance as first argument automatically
    -by convention we should call instance self(can be whatever) but stick to convention after self we can specify what other args we want to accept

-name,email,pay etc >attributes of aour class

-if let forgot self argument then>eg in fullname no self>TypeError
    fullname takes 0 posnl. args

-can run methods using class name itself
